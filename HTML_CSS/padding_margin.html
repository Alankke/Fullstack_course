      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds, the
        grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and
        soldier Toivo Karanko.
        His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the
        Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.
        He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code:
        Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the Peanuts
        cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying
        cartoon character".
