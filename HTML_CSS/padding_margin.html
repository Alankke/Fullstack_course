        <h3>Linus Torvalds</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Linus Benedict Torvalds born 28 December 1969 is a Finnish and American software engineer who is the creator
          and lead developer of the Linux kernel. He also created the distributed version control system Git.
          He was honored, along with Shinya Yamanaka, with the 2012 Millennium Technology Prize by the Technology
          Academy
          Finland "in recognition of his creation of a new open source operating system for computers leading to the
          widely used Linux kernel".
          He is also the recipient of the 2014 IEEE Computer Society Computer Pioneer Award and the 2018 IEEE Masaru

        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <hr>
        <p>Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on 28 December 1969, the son of journalists Anna and Nils Torvalds,
          the
          grandson of statistician Leo Törnqvist and of poet Ole Torvalds, and the great-grandson of journalist and
          soldier Toivo Karanko.
          His parents were campus radicals at the University of Helsinki in the 1960s. His family belongs to the
          Swedish-speaking minority in Finland.
          He was named after Linus Pauling, the Nobel Prize–winning American chemist, although in the book Rebel Code:
          Linux and the Open Source Revolution, he is quoted as saying, "I think I was named equally for Linus the
          Peanuts
          cartoon character", noting that this made him "half Nobel Prize–winning chemist and half blanket-carrying
          cartoon character".
